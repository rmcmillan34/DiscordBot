## Introduction
This project was created with the intention of honing my python programming, and artificial intelligence/machine learning skills.  
I intend this bot to be a testing ground for experimenting with textual NLP models and voice recognition.  
The idea to create a chat bot came from aceking007's [#100ProjectssOfCode](https://github.com/aceking007/100ProjectsOfCode) repository.  
  
## Features
Currently RizzBot has the following engrained functionalities:  
[x] Welcome a new user to the discord server.  
  
## Features to Add
The following is a list of features that I intend to add to this project.  
[] Train an Artificial Neural Network to give RizzBot the ability to communicate.  
[] Link to this README.md on github in the !help command  
[] Scissors Paper Rock vs RizzBot  
[] Scissors Paper Rock vs another server member  
[] Adjudicate games of odds between server members  
[] Ask Jeopardy Questions, wait and tell the answer
